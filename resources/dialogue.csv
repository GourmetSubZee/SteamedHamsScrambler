Speaker;Line
SKINNER;Well, Seymour, I made it, despite your directions.
CHALMERS;Ah, Superintendent Chalmers! Welcome. I hope you're prepared for an unforgettable luncheon!
SKINNER;Oh egads! My roast is ruined!
SKINNER;But what if I were to purchase fast food and disguise it as my own cooking? Ho ho ho, delightfully devilish, Seymour.
SINGERS;♪ Skinner with his crazy explanations, the superintendent's gonna need his medication. ♪
SINGERS;♪ When he hears Skinner's lame exaggerations, there'll be trouble in town tonight! ♪
CHALMERS;SEYMOUR!
SKINNER;Superintendent, I was just stretching my calves on the windowsill. Isometric exercise. Care to join me?
CHALMERS;Why is there smoke coming out of your oven, Seymour?
SKINNER;Uh... Ooh! That isn't smoke, it's steam! Steam from the steamed clams we're having. Mmm, steamed clams!
CHALMERS;I thought we were having steamed clams.
SKINNER;Oh no, I said steamed hams. That's what I call hamburgers.
CHALMERS;You call hamburgers "steamed hams"?
SKINNER;Yes. It's a regional dialect.
CHALMERS;Uh-huh. Uh, what region?
SKINNER;Uh... upstate New York?
CHALMERS;Really? Well I'm from Utica and I've never heard anyone use the phrase "steamed hams."
SKINNER;Oh, not in Utica, no. It's an Albany expression.
CHALMERS;I see...
CHALMERS;You know, these hamburgers are quite similar to the ones they have at Krusty Burger.
SKINNER;Oh ho ho no! Patented Skinner burgers. Old family recipe!
CHALMERS;For steamed hams?
SKINNER;Yes...
CHALMERS;Yes, and you call them steamed hams despite the fact they are obviously grilled.
SKINNER;You know — one thing I should... excuse me for one second.
CHALMERS;Of course.
CHALMERS;Well, that was wonderful. A good time was had by all. I'm pooped.
SKINNER;Yes, I should be— Good Lord, what is happening in there?!
CHALMERS;Aurora Borealis?
SKINNER;Uh— Aurora Borealis?! At this time of year, at this time of day, in this part of the country, localized entirely within your kitchen?!
CHALMERS;Yes!
SKINNER;...May I see it?
CHALMERS;No.
AGNES;Seymour! The house is on fire!
SKINNER;No, Mother, it's just the Northern Lights.
CHALMERS;Well, Seymour, you are an odd fellow, but I must say — you steam a good ham.
